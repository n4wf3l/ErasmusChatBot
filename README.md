# Chatbot Project README

## Project Overview

This project, developed in collaboration with Kristian Vasiaj, is part of an academic assignment for the AI Essentials course taught by Domien Hennion. It involves the development of a Chatbot capable of discussing various topics related to Erasmushogeschool Brussel. The chatbot provides credible information based on data stored in an Azure Blob Storage container, which integrates all the school's data, including ECTS sheets. Several additional features have been developed:

- Start a new conversation session
- Delete a conversation session
- Clear all LocalStorage data from the site
- A Snake game for waiting (1 prompt per minute)
- Audio feature to read the Bot's responses aloud
